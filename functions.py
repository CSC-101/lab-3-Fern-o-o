# Double the value of a number.
# Input: a number to be doubled
# Result: a number
def double(n:int) -> int:
    result = n * 2
    return result

#No, only because it worked for 2 does not mean that it is correct, it needs to work for all
#values not just two. You need to test your code until you are sure that no other variables
#might cause it to break for example 2 which was the only object that caused it to break but
#in a larger line of code it could be more than one just like 2
